# DunCraMaz

DunCraMaz is a command-line based fantasy dungeon crawler gameEngine that takes place in a maze.

It is a simple Java project I created whilst learning the basics of the language. It is being
uploaded here primarily to serve as practice as I learn how to use Git.

## Premise:

The player begins in the top left corner of the maze, and must reach the bottom right to escape.
The path to the escape is ridden with randomly-placed Orcs, Trolls, and foes of a far older and
fouler type originating from the deep places of the world...
